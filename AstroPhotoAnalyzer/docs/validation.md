# Validation

The project's memory of "how well it works, measured on what". Every case lives in
`validation.json`, read by `ValidationTests` (trait `Category=Validation`, not in the gate,
ADR 0004), and is explained here. A number changes only after a re-measurement, with a dated
line under History saying the old value, the new value and why; never by editing the expected
values to match (the kit's rule "No test edited to pass").

The data is one image, `de_printat.png`: the owner's Milky Way core, 5938 x 3888, 16-bit RGB PNG,
103 387 067 bytes, whose original is in `E:\Photografie\Claude`. A copy of it, made by hand,
sits in `AstroPhotoAnalyzer.Tests/testdata/large/`, which git ignores, and
`AstroPhotoAnalyzer.Tests/testdata/manifest.json` holds its SHA-256. On a machine or in a
worktree without the copy, the cases print `NOT MEASURED` and pass.

## How a case runs

One kind of case, `analysis`: `AnalysisRun.Execute` on the image with the parameters the case
names (`aspect`, `distanceM`, `dmax`, `medium`, `targetBg`; an absent one is the core's
default), exactly as the console runs it. `ValidationTests` reads from the result a fixed set of
figures, named by the record and field they come from (`tonal.pctBelowPaperBlack`,
`stars.fwhmMedian`, `size.recommendedWidthCm`), and prints them all as one JSON line, `MEASURED
<id> {...}`, in the test output and in the file `APA_VALIDATION_DUMP` names when it is set. A
case's `expected` lists the figures it guards: a number within the case's `tolerance` (absolute,
in the figure's own unit), an integer, a boolean or a string exactly. A case whose `expected` is
`null` is unmeasured: it prints what it found and passes.

```bash
dotnet test AstroPhotoAnalyzer.sln -c Release --filter "Category=Validation"
```

Or `/validate` in Claude Code, which prints the expected and measured figures of every case and
stops on a drift instead of editing them.

## Cases

| ID | Parameters | What it guards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V-001 | none: the full frame, baryta, the natural distance | every figure of the reference run on the full frame: tones, L\*, the simulation at 0.19, noise, plateau, rounding, stress test, JPEG and TIFF, stars, background colour, the bottom-right corner, the size table's reference row, the overall verdict |
| V-002 | `aspect` 50:35, `distanceM` 1.5 | the run of the acceptance record, the hallway scenario: the crop, the 70 cm row, the recommended width, the verdict |
| V-003 | `dmax` 2.35 | the figure measured on 2026-10-01 for a baryta paper that reaches Dmax 2.35 on a good printer: 1.3 % below paper black, print-safe; a guard on the paper-black maths more than on the image |

The figures recorded for each case are in `validation.json`; the table below, from the reference
run of 2026-09-21, gives the same measurements made by hand in the originating conversation.

## The reference run

Until 2026-10-02 the rest of this file was `docs/acceptance-de-printat.md`, moved here unchanged
(ADR 0001).

The tool was built to reproduce, and then automate, the measurements made by hand (Python
/ NumPy / ImageMagick) on one image in the conversation that started it:
`de_printat.png`, a Milky Way core, 5938 x 3888, 16-bit RGB PNG, sRGB (`sRGB-elle-V2`),
98.6 MB. The image is not in the repo. This file records the run of the finished tool on
it, next to the hand-made numbers.

Run: `AstroPhotoAnalyzer.exe de_printat.png --aspect 50:35 --distance 1.5` (the hallway
scenario from the conversation), version 1.0.0, 11 seconds on the whole 23 MP.

### What the tool said that the conversation also said

Verdict PROBLEMA. Send TIFF 8-bit LZW; if only JPEG, q100 and never below (q95 max
error 27). No visible banding on 8 bits (plateau 0.34 mm at 202 dpi). Background too low
for baryta - 45.6 % under paper black - re-stretch from linear to 0.19. Green cast of
+1.6 on the background. Warm bottom-right corner (R +9.4, B -9.9) and warm bottom edge:
horizon glow, fix on linear or keep as composition. Recommended 70 x 49 cm at 1.5 m; the
50:35 target cuts 192 px per side. Denoise pressed hard for print: sigma 0.45, target
0.8-1.5, and after the re-stretch it becomes ~0.61. Keep the 16-bit master: 46 levels
missing from 8 bits after a shadow lift, none from 16.

### What the real image taught the tool

- **Edge regions that brighten neutrally are the object, not a gradient.** The first run
  flagged all eight edge regions as "residual gradient" because the Milky Way band enters
  the top-left corner (+11 / +10 / +16). The rule now separates coloured departures
  (channels move differently: light pollution, horizon glow - Attention) from neutral
  ones (channels move together: most likely the object - informative). On this image that
  leaves exactly the two warm regions the conversation had found.
- **FWHM in the centre region reads 4.27 px** against 2.8-3.3 in the corners: the core is
  nebulosity, stars there sit on a bright, structured base and the border median
  overestimates it. The corner/centre ratio (0.77) is therefore not a sharpness statement
  on this image; the global median (3.13) is.
- **The plateau tiles are scarce here** (20 of 5000 attempts): a frame this full of
  structure has little sky that is flat to 6 levels. The number still matches the hand
  measurement.
- **ImageSharp's LZW needs the horizontal predictor** to be comparable to ImageMagick's.
- **Run without `--distance`, the first version recommended 50 x 33 cm** where the
  conversation had said "up to 100 cm at the natural distance, 70 for the hallway". At
  the natural distance the point-or-disc test is size-independent (the ratio is 1.018 for
  this image, a constant), so every row failed by 2 % and the rule fell back to the
  smallest. The rule now carries a 15 % tolerance there, recommends the largest
  non-oversize size when the image passes, and says in the report that the size is the
  wall's choice and that a given distance is what separates the sizes. With `--distance
  1.5` (the hallway) the recommendation is 70 cm on the 50:35 crop, as in the
  conversation; on the full frame it is 80 (FWHM 3.13 instead of 3.00).

## History

- 2026-10-02: the acceptance record became this file (ADR 0001); V-001 to V-003 created
  unmeasured, to be filled from the build of the same day.
